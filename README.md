Visualization of poems made by on Processing

Hi, guys!
It's my first proejct on Processing and GitHub!

Main principle of visualisation of uploading txt files:
e.g. 6 letters in a word = a circle with a radius of 6 pixels.

This is the 1st version of the Project and I'm gonna improve the project in the nearest future.


Thank you for attention!


## How to use:
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org)https://processing.org))
2. Download poem.pde and Save to your directory
3. Download Pushkin.txt and put the file into directory with your poem.pde
4. Go to Tools > Manage Tools > type "SVG" and install the P8gGraphicsSVG plugin by Philippe Lhoste to export your results as SVG
5. Launch code
6. See the visual result or take it as SVG file-format right in your folder with the project
7. You are great!

P.S. If you wanna place your own text and check the result â€“ put your text into Pushkin.txt file.
P.S.S. Press S in your view to save the result as PNG.
