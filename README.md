Visualization of poems made by on Processing

Hi, guys!
It's my first proejct on Processing and GitHub!

Main principle of visualisation of uploading txt files:
e.g. 6 letters in a word = a circle with a radius of 6 pixels.

This is the 1st version of the Project and I'm gonna improve the project in the nearest future.


Thank you for attention!
